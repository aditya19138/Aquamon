Water wastage has become so common for today’s world. We don’t even realise how much
water is wasted in our own homes due to negligence like keeping the tap on while filling buckets
which leads to overflow of water in enormous amounts. Even when we are aware, we fail to
realise how much water is wasted throughout the day.  
Many People around the country , or infact , globally live in conditions where they don’t even
have water for drinking.We are living in the time when we need to save clean water and use it
according to our use only. People at many places in India and other countries are facing a huge
water scarcity. They have to depend on the government water supply by tanks or some natural
water reservoirs at long distance. They have to go for a long distance on daily basis to arrange
drinking water. They better understand the value of water than the people who have sufficient
water supply in their areas. The situation of lack of water becomes very terrible for the people
who don’t have enough water to fulfill their basic needs of drinking, bathing, washing, etc
According to an Indian government report, scientists of India have warned 21 cities will run out a
groundwater in the year 2020.  
In 2019, the city of Latur experienced a great water shortage. Much of the local economy and
farming regions nearly collapsed with the citizens having no choice but to use the polluted
water.
Thus , this water wastage in our own homes when combined for all the houses across the
country leads to tons and tons of water getting wasted which could be used to provide basic
amenities to a large section of population
